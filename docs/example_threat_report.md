### Volt Typhoon Supply Chain Campaign

In 2024, the Chinese state-sponsored group Volt Typhoon launched a campaign targeting U.S. critical infrastructure, leveraging the supply chain as an entry point to infiltrate utilities, manufacturing, and transportation sectors.

The group employed living-off-the-land techniques, exploiting trusted tools within third-party vendors' networks to blend into normal operations and avoid detection.

Their activities aimed to establish persistent access in critical systems, positioning themselves to disrupt communications and infrastructure during potential conflicts in the Taiwan Strait.

A significant aspect of this campaign was Volt Typhoon's use of vulnerabilities in supply chain dependencies to compromise OT environments.

By targeting third-party vendors managing OT systems, the group disrupted key communication networks and exposed vulnerabilities in energy grids.

The surge in supply chain attacks in 2024 reflects the evolving tactics of adversaries and the growing dependence of digital ecosystems.

These attacks exploit the inherent trust between vendors and customers, targeting software libraries, cloud environments, and critical infrastructure sectors.

A notable trend this year has been the phenomenon of more customers impacted by fewer software supply-chain breaches, highlighting the disproportionate reach and efficiency of these attacks.

Organizations must adapt to these challenges by securing their supply chains and addressing vulnerabilities in both technical and operational processes.

# Predictions for Cybersecurity in 2025 Based on 2024 Trends

## Increased Targeting of Critical Sectors

Ransomware actors will continue prioritizing sectors like healthcare, emergency services, and utilities, where downtime is intolerable.

These industries' operational dependencies and critical nature make them lucrative targets.

In 2024, we observed a shift toward precision attacks, emphasizing sectors where disruption can yield the greatest financial and operational impact, a trend expected to intensify in 2025.

## Adoption of Advanced Ransomware Tactics

Threat actors are continuously evolving their approaches, with double and triple extortion now standard practice.

These tactics not only threaten data leaks but extend to targeting third parties, such as customers and partners, intensifying pressure on victims.

In 2025, ransomware groups are expected to adopt new strategies, including the use of AI to enhance attack precision and the exploitation of interconnected systems for greater disruption.

Increasingly, attackers may bypass the encryption stage altogether, opting to exfiltrate sensitive data and demand payment for its return, reflecting a shift toward faster and more aggressive extortion methods.

## Enhanced Regulation and Cybersecurity Standards

The expansion of global cybersecurity regulations in 2025 is expected to reshape the threat landscape, potentially forcing ransomware groups and cybercriminals to adapt their strategies.

As governments impose stricter data protection laws and mandate incident response protocols, larger organizations are likely to bolster their defenses, which may drive attackers to shift focus toward smaller, less-regulated entities and third-party vendors.

This could result in a rise in supply chain attacks and ransomware campaigns aimed at disrupting operations rather than stealing data, allowing attackers to bypass regulatory scrutiny.

While these regulations may lower the frequency of successful attacks on critical infrastructure, they could create a more selective, high-impact threat environment where adversaries prioritize targets with weaker defenses and greater operational dependencies.

## Lines Between Hacktivists, APTs, and Cybercriminals Will Continue to Blur

The lines between hacktivists, APT groups, and cybercriminals are expected to blur even further in 2025, as these actors increasingly collaborate or adopt each other’s tactics to achieve overlapping objectives.

Nation-states will continue to leverage ransomware groups and hacktivists to carry out politically motivated attacks while maintaining plausible deniability, turning financial cybercrime into a tool for espionage and disruption.

Likewise, ransomware operators are already aligning with APT groups to enhance their capabilities, using nation-state resources to bypass defenses and conduct more destructive attacks.

This convergence will continue to complicate attribution in 2025, making it harder for defenders to distinguish between ideologically driven attacks and financially motivated cybercrime, ultimately increasing the complexity of response and mitigation efforts.

## Erosion of Trust in Supply Chain Relationship

The dependency on third-party vendors remains a critical vulnerability.

In 2025, we expect organizations to demand greater transparency and stricter security measures from vendors.

Supply chain attacks in 2024 demonstrated how attackers exploit interconnected ecosystems, requiring a reevaluation of trust across industries.

# CyberProof’s Recommendations

The following proactive steps are recommended to reduce threat impact:

## AI to Fight AI

Implement AI-based security solutions that can detect and respond to AI-implemented attacks in real-time, including:

1. Develop or use Machine Learning countermeasures and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect advanced stealthy threats, such as regular Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) domains, polymorphic malware, and granular malware behavior.
2. Create a baseline of the network traffic to look for anomalous activity, such as unexpected data transfers or incoming connections from unknown sources.

## Keep Up to Date With the Geopolitical Threat Landscape

Ensure your defense tools track threat actors associated with countries that may target your industry.

Keep up to date with industry-specific geopolitical developments and plan your cyber defense accordingly.

## Implement Backup and Disaster Recovery Plans

Have a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plan in place to ensure the availability of critical systems in the event of a security breach or natural disaster.

## Regularly Scan for Vulnerabilities

Conduct regular vulnerability scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities – especially those on external-facing devices – to limit the attack surface.

## Create Detection Rules and Playbooks

Implement detection rules and playbooks, keeping them up to date with current sophisticated ransomware attacks and system malfunction scenarios to deploy mitigation techniques.

## Segment Your Networks

Apply zero-trust principles to further segment your networks, minimizing the risk of lateral compromise.

Implement separate networks for IT and OT systems to prevent potential breaches from spreading between environments.

## Use Encryption

Encrypt sensitive data and communications to protect against unauthorized access or data being intercepted or harvested.

## Train Employees on Social Engineering Techniques

Run phishing simulations using in-the-wild campaigns, so that employees get into the habit of recognizing and reporting phishing attempts and other suspicious activity.
